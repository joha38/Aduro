## Troubleshooting

### Stove Not Found

- Ensure stove is powered on and connected to network
- Check that serial number and PIN are correct
- Check firewall settings

### Commands Not Working

- Check Home Assistant logs for errors
- Ensure stove is not in wood mode (state 9 or 14)
- Try restarting the integration

### Temperature Alerts Not Triggering

- Verify smoke and shaft temperature sensors are working
- Check that alert thresholds are appropriate for your stove
- Review logs for temperature detection messages
- Default thresholds (370°C for high smoke, 175°C for low wood) may need adjustment

### Unknown States

If you see "Unknown State X" in sensors:
1. Check Home Assistant logs for warnings
2. Note the state and substate number
3. Note the state and substate in aduro hybrid application
4. See [ADDING_STATES.md](ADDING_STATES.md) for how to add it
5. Report it via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/NewImproved/Aduro/issues)

### Enable Debug Logging

Add to `configuration.yaml`:
```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.aduro: debug
```

## Migration from YAML/Python Scripts

If you're migrating from the manual YAML configuration:

1. **Backup** your current configuration
2. **Remove** old automations and files using `python_script.exec`
3. **Remove** old template sensors
4. **Install** this integration
5. **Configure** via UI
6. **Update** automations to use new service calls
7. **Test** all functionality

The integration preserves all functionality:
- ✅ Mode change tracking with retries
- ✅ External change detection
- ✅ Pellet tracking and notifications
- ✅ Timer countdowns
- ✅ Auto start/stop detection
- ✅ Wood mode support
- ✅ Temperature monitoring and alerts

### Adding Translations

To add a new language:

1. Copy `translations/en.json` to `translations/[lang].json`
2. Translate all text values
3. Submit a pull request

### Reporting Unknown States

If your stove reports states not in the integration:

1. Check logs for state warnings
2. Create a GitHub issue with:
   - State number
   - Stove model
   - The state and substate number
   - The corresponding state and substate in aduro hybrid application

See [ADDING_STATES.md](ADDING_STATES.md) for details.

## Development plans/wish list

- For Alpha-releases: test that all functions are working as intended.
- Update integration with all relevant translations between state/substates-numbers and their related text string.
- Get confirmation/information about the remaining Aduro hybrid stoves.
- Estimation of pellets consumption over time, depending on temperature settings, heat level settings, outside temperature and other relevant factors to estimate a time for when the stove have consumed all pellets.
- External and wireless temperature sensor is available as an accessory. Could it be possible to use other temperature sensors and send the information to the stove via Home Assistant?
