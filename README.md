## Troubleshooting

### Stove Not Found

- Ensure stove is powered on and connected to network
- Check that serial number and PIN are correct
- Verify MQTT broker is running and accessible
- Check firewall settings

### Commands Not Working

- Verify MQTT credentials are correct
- Check Home Assistant logs for errors
- Ensure stove is not in wood mode (state 9 or 14)
- Try restarting the integration

### Unknown States

If you see "Unknown State X" in sensors:
1. Check Home Assistant logs for warnings
2. Note the state and substate number
3. Note the state and substate in aduro hybrid application
4. See [ADDING_STATES.md](ADDING_STATES.md) for how to add it
5. Report it via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/NewImproved/Aduro/issues)

### Enable Debug Logging

Add to `configuration.yaml`:
```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.aduro: debug
```

## Migration from YAML/Python Scripts

If you're migrating from the manual YAML configuration:

1. **Backup** your current configuration
2. **Remove** old automations using `python_script.exec`
3. **Remove** old template sensors
4. **Install** this integration
5. **Configure** via UI
6. **Update** automations to use new service calls
7. **Test** all functionality

The integration preserves all functionality:
- ✅ Mode change tracking with retries
- ✅ External change detection
- ✅ Pellet tracking and notifications
- ✅ Timer countdowns
- ✅ Auto start/stop detection
- ✅ Wood mode support
